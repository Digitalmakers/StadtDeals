â–¡ Any new risks identified?
â–¡ Documentation updated?
```

### Weekly Monitoring (Team Lead)

**Monday Planning:**
```markdown
â–¡ Last week's velocity vs. plan
â–¡ This week's sprint goals achievable?
â–¡ Resource allocation optimal?
â–¡ Dependency risks for the week?

## Automated Monitoring

### Firebase Monitoring

**Budget Alerts:**
```javascript
// Firebase Functions: Budget monitor
exports.checkBudget = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 4 hours')
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    const usage = await getFirebaseUsage();
    
    if (usage.percentage > 75) {
      await sendAlert('WARNING: Firebase usage at ' + usage.percentage + '%');
    }
    
    if (usage.dailyBurn > usage.budgetedDaily * 1.2) {
      await sendAlert('CRITICAL: Daily burn rate 20% over budget');
    }
  });
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```javascript
// Function execution time alerts
exports.performanceMonitor = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const metrics = await getPerformanceMetrics();
  
  const alerts = [];
  if (metrics.p95ResponseTime > 500) {
    alerts.push('API response time exceeding 500ms (p95)');
  }
  
  if (metrics.errorRate > 0.01) {
    alerts.push('Error rate exceeding 1%');
  }
  
  if (alerts.length > 0) {
    await sendPerformanceAlert(alerts);
  }
});
```

### CI/CD Monitoring

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
```yaml

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9,17 * * 1-5' # 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Build Status
        run: |
          # Check last 10 builds
          SUCCESS_RATE=$(gh run list --limit 10 --json conclusion \
            | jq '[.[] | select(.conclusion=="success")] | length')
          
          if [ $SUCCESS_RATE -lt 8 ]; then
            echo "::warning::Build success rate below 80%"
          fi
      
      - name: Check Test Coverage
        run: |
          COVERAGE=$(cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total.lines.pct')
          
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "::error::Test coverage below 80%"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Check Dependencies
        run: |
          npm audit --production
          
      - name: Send Summary
        if: always()
        run: |
          # Send to Slack/Discord/Email
```

## Risk Register Template

### Risk Entry Format

```markdown
**Risk ID**: RISK-001
**Date Identified**: 2025-07-31
**Category**: Technical
**Title**: Firebase Authentication Service Outage

**Description**: 
Potential unavailability of Firebase Auth service blocking user login

**Probability**: Low (1-5): 2
**Impact**: High (1-5): 5
**Risk Score**: 10 (P x I)

**Indicators**:
- Firebase status page shows issues
- Login success rate drops below 95%
- Support tickets about login failures

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache auth tokens locally for 24 hours
- Status page monitoring automated
- Fallback to custom token generation if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Switch to backup auth provider (prepared but not implemented)
- Extend token validity temporarily
- Communicate with users via push notifications

**Owner**: Backend Team Lead
**Status**: Active - Monitoring
```
