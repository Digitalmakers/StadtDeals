## 5. Security & Compliance Pipeline

### Security Scanning

```yaml
security-checks:
  - name: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
    tool: npm audit + Snyk
    frequency: Every PR + Daily
    
  - name: Code Security Analysis
    tool: CodeQL + SonarCloud

  - name: Container Security Scan
    tool: Trivy
    frequency: Every build
    
  - name: Infrastructure Security
    tool: Checkov (Firebase rules)
    frequency: Infrastructure changes
```

### Compliance Checks

- **GDPR Compliance**: Automated checks for data handling
- **App Store Guidelines**: Metadata and content validation
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Automated testing and validation
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and authentication validation

---

## 6. Monitoring & Alerting

### Build Monitoring

```yaml
monitoring:
  build_success_rate:
    threshold: ">95%"
    alert_channel: "#dev-alerts"
    
  build_duration:
    ios_threshold: "<20 minutes"
    android_threshold: "<15 minutes"
    alert_channel: "#dev-alerts"
    
  test_coverage:
    threshold: ">80%"
    trend_alert: "decreasing for 3 builds"
    
  deployment_success:
    threshold: "100%"
    rollback_trigger: "any failure"
```

### Performance Monitoring

- **Build Performance**: Track build times and resource usage
- **Test Performance**: Monitor test execution times
- **Deployment Speed**: Track deployment duration
- **Success Rates**: Monitor success/failure rates across all pipelines

---

## 7. Rollback & Recovery Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers

```yaml
rollback_conditions:
  - build_failure_rate: ">10% in 1 hour"
  - test_failure_rate: ">5% in 30 minutes"
  - deployment_failure: "immediate"
  - security_vulnerability: "critical level"
```

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Restore previous working version
2. **Investigation**: Automated issue creation with logs
3. **Communication**: Team notification with status
4. **Resolution**: Fix forward or maintain rollback

---

## 8. Development Workflow Integration

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
main_branch_protection:
  required_status_checks:
    - "quality-checks"
    - "unit-tests"
    - "component-tests"
    - "build-verification"
  require_code_owner_reviews: true
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_linear_history: true
```

### Automated Actions

- **PR Auto-labeling**: Based on changed files
- **Changelog Generation**: From conventional commits
- **Version Bumping**: Semantic versioning automation
- **Release Notes**: Automated generation for app stores

---

## 9. Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization

- **Dependency Caching**: npm, CocoaPods, Gradle caches
- **Parallel Execution**: Matrix builds for platforms
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild changed components
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimized runner specifications

### Cost Optimization

- **Conditional Execution**: Skip unnecessary jobs
- **Efficient Runners**: Right-sized compute resources
- **Cache Strategy**: Maximize cache hit rates
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Off-peak infrastructure tasks

---

## 10. Success Metrics & KPIs

### Pipeline Performance

| Metric | Target | Current | Trend |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Build Success Rate | >95% | - | - |
| Average Build Time (iOS) | <20 min | - | - |
| Average Build Time (Android) | <15 min | - | - |
| Test Coverage | >80% | - | - |
| Security Issues | 0 critical | - | - |
| Deployment Frequency | 2x/week | - | - |

### Quality Metrics

- **Bug Escape Rate**: Issues found in production vs staging
- **Lead Time**: Feature development to production deployment
- **Recovery Time**: Time to fix broken builds
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing issues
