# 5. Development Environment & Testing

## iOS Development (Primary):

- **Physical Device**: Development and direct testing of the React Native app on a connected iPhone (via cable).
- **iOS Simulator**: Use of the iOS Simulator (part of Xcode) for rapid iterations.

## Android Development (Secondary/Later):

- **Android Emulator**: Use of the Android Emulator (part of Android Studio) for testing.

## Development Features:

- **Automatic Live Refresh (Fast Refresh)**: Code changes are displayed automatically and almost instantly on the connected physical device or simulator.
- **Debug Tools**: Use of React Native debugging tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools for JavaScript debugging, React Native Debugger).

## Testing Strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for business logic (Firebase Functions) and React Native components.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for interactions between components and services.
- **End-to-End Tests (E2E)**: Automated E2E tests for critical user workflows.
- **Device Tests**: Regular testing on physical devices and simulators/emulators to identify platform-specific issues.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integration of automated tests into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
