- Checkout with multi-vendor shopping cart, promocode validation & split payment via Stripe Connect (incl. 3D Secure & Refund API).
- Order status tracking (detailed status chain) & refund functionality with escalation.
- 1:1 Unified Chat per customer-vendor pair (customer can initiate; vendor can only reply or proactively initiate if an order exists).
- Role-based user management (Admin/Vendor/Customer).
- Push & email notifications.
