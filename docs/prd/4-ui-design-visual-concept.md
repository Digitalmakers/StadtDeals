# 4. UI Design & Visual Concept

The UI design of StadtDeals is based on a modern, clean, and functional style, inspired by references such as Bolt Food. It emphasizes intuitive user guidance and an appealing, consistent appearance.

## 4.1 Visual Identity & Design Language

**Overall Style:** Modern, clean, minimalist, and functional. Focus on content and ease of use.

### Color Palette:

- **Primary Color (Accent/Interactive):** A warm, accessible Orange (for primary CTAs, links, active states).
- **Neutral Colors:** Pure white (#FFFFFF) or very light off-white for backgrounds. Dark anthracite/near-black for primary text, medium gray for secondary text. Very light gray for separators/borders.
- **Status Colors:** Muted green (success), darkened yellow (warning), clear red (error).

**Typography:** A modern, highly legible sans-serif typeface for the entire app. A clear font size and weight system for hierarchy.

**Iconography:** Simple, linear icons.

## 4.2 Layout & Navigation

- **Clear Screens:** Plenty of white space, clear hierarchy through spacing and typography.
- **Card-based Design:** Use of cards for products, vendors, and order summaries for visual separation.

### Main Navigation (Customer App - 5 Tabs at the Bottom):

1. **Home/Discover:** Home screen with personalized content, offers, categories, and the search bar in the header.
2. **Vendors/Stores:** Dedicated tab for Browse, filtering, and finding vendors.
3. **Search:** Dedicated, comprehensive search tab for both products and vendors.
4. **Orders:** Overview of current and past orders.
5. **Profile/My Account:** Access to personal settings and management.

**Top Navigation (Header):** Clear title, action icons (search icon, notifications, shopping cart badge), back arrow.

**Secondary Navigation:** Filter and sort options as a top bar or pop-up modal. Modals/bottom sheets for actions and detailed selections.

**Transitions:** Smooth, native transitions and subtle animations.

## 4.3 Important UI Components

### Buttons:

- **Primary CTAs:** Solid fill, warm orange background, white text, slightly rounded corners.
- **Secondary Buttons:** Transparent background, orange border and text.
- **Text Buttons:** Text only, in the orange primary color.

**Input Fields:** Clean, minimalist, light background, subtle gray border. Border highlighted in orange when focused. Clear labels. OTP entry in separate boxes.

### Product Cards & List Views:

- **Product Cards:** Clean, card-based, high-quality product images, clear info (name, price, vendor name). Discount badges in Orange.
- **Quantity Stepper:** Dynamic quantity + stepper directly on the product card (for fixed items) or within the configuration modal (for gastronomy).
- **List Views:** Clear rows, subtle separators, icons/status indicators.

**Dynamic "View Cart" Bar:** Large, primary button at the bottom of the screen, in Orange, appearing when items are in the cart, displaying the total sum.

**Dynamic Free Delivery Hint:** Message in the checkout showing progress towards free delivery.

**Camera Overlay (Vendor App):** Transparent overlay with size/aspect ratio guidelines and visual quality indicators (brightness, blur) for product photos.

**Configuration Modal (Gastronomy):** Bottom sheet with clear option groups (headings), selection mechanisms (radio buttons for single selection, checkboxes for multiple selection), and dynamic price updates.

**Form Validation:** Real-time feedback directly on the field, clear error messages.

**In-App Browser:** Use of in-app browsers for external links (e.g., T&Cs).

## 4.4 Onboarding Design Principles

**Style:** Clean, minimalist, functional.

**Progress:** Linear flow for customers; explicit step indicator for web-based vendor onboarding.

**Visual Guidance:** Use of icons and colors to guide through the process (e.g., for OTP entry).
