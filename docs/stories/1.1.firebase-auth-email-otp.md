# Story 1.1: Firebase Authentication Setup & Email/OTP Login

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Customer/Vendor,  
**I want** to securely log in using my email and OTP verification,  
**so that** I can access personalized features and my account is protected

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email address
2. OTP sent via email for verification during registration
3. Users can log in with email and OTP
4. Login session persists across app restarts
5. Logout functionality clears session completely
6. Error handling for invalid credentials and network issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/2-data-model-management-firestore.md#collections]
**users collection schema:**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;           // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;         // User email address
  role: 'customer' | 'vendor' | 'admin';  // User role (customer default)
  profile: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    phone?: string;
    location?: GeoPoint;
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/3-api-design-business-logic-firebase-functions.md#authentication-authorization]
- App sends Firebase Auth ID Tokens in the `Authorization` header
- Each protected Function verifies the token and checks the user's role and permissions from the `users` collection
- Server-side validation mandatory for all incoming data
- RESTful API principles with `/api/v1/` versioning
- Consistent JSON error responses with status, code, message, details

**Required Firebase Functions:**
- `sendOTPEmail` - Generate and send OTP via email
- `verifyOTP` - Server-side OTP validation and user creation
- `getUserProfile` - Retrieve user profile data

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/1-technology-stack.md]
- **State Management**: Zustand for authentication state
- **UI Library**: NativeBase components for forms and inputs
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form + zod for validation
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with authentication guards

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-development-environment-testing.md#testing-strategy]
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for business logic and React Native components
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between authentication components and Firebase
- **Test Location**: `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
- **Framework**: Jest for unit testing, React Native Testing Library for component testing
- **Coverage Target**: >85% for authentication flows

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/1-technology-stack.md]
- Firebase Auth Latest version for OTP authentication
- React Native CLI (not Expo) for native capabilities
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- EU region compliance for data storage

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/5-development-environment-testing.md]
- **Test File Location**: Create `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native preset
- **Component Testing**: React Native Testing Library for UI components
- **Test Standards**: 
  - Test all success and error scenarios
  - Mock Firebase services for unit tests
  - Test user interactions and state changes
  - Verify error handling and validation
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test authentication flow with valid/invalid credentials
  - Test session persistence across app restarts
  - Test network error handling
  - Verify security of token storage
