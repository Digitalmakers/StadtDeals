# Story 1.2: User Role Management & Authorization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** Admin,  
**I want** role-based access control for different user types,  
**so that** Customers, Vendors, and Admins have appropriate permissions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User roles defined: Customer, Vendor, Admin
2. Role assignment during registration (Customer default)
3. Role-based navigation and feature access
4. Admin can view and modify user roles
5. Firestore Security Rules enforce role permissions
6. API endpoints validate user roles before actions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Authentication system is fully functional with Zustand store
- User interface already includes role field (customer default)
- AuthService provides session management and user creation
- Navigation structure exists with AuthGuard for protected routes
- TypeScript interfaces established for User data model

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/2-data-model-management-firestore.md#collections]
**users collection schema (already implemented):**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;           // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;         // User email address
  role: 'customer' | 'vendor' | 'admin';  // User role (customer default)
  profile: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    phone?: string;
    location?: GeoPoint;
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

**Required Extensions:**
```typescript
interface UserRole {
  role: 'customer' | 'vendor' | 'admin';
  permissions: string[];
  assignedAt: Timestamp;
  assignedBy?: string; // Admin who assigned the role
}

interface AdminUserListItem {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'customer' | 'vendor' | 'admin';
  profile: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lastLogin?: Timestamp;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/3-api-design-business-logic-firebase-functions.md#authentication-authorization]
- App sends Firebase Auth ID Tokens in the `Authorization` header
- Each protected Function verifies the token and checks the user's role and permissions from the `users` collection
- Server-side validation mandatory for all incoming data
- RESTful API principles with `/api/v1/` versioning
- Consistent JSON error responses with status, code, message, details

**Required Firebase Functions:**
- `getUsersByRole` - Admin function to retrieve users by role
- `updateUserRole` - Admin function to modify user roles
- `validateUserPermission` - Utility to check user permissions
- `getRolePermissions` - Get available permissions for a role

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/1-technology-stack.md]
- **State Management**: Zustand for role-based state management
- **UI Library**: NativeBase components for admin interface
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form + zod for role assignment forms
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with role-based route guards

**New Components Required:**

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-development-environment-testing.md#testing-strategy]
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for role-based business logic and React Native components
- **Integration Tests**: Test role interactions between components and Firebase
- **Test Location**: `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
- **Framework**: Jest for unit testing, React Native Testing Library for component testing
- **Coverage Target**: >85% for role management flows

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/1-technology-stack.md]
- Firebase Auth Latest version for role management
- React Native CLI (not Expo) for native capabilities
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- EU region compliance for data storage
- **Security**: Role-based access must be enforced at database level with Firestore Security Rules

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/3-api-design-business-logic-firebase-functions.md]
- All role changes must be logged and auditable
- Admin privileges must be verified server-side
- Role assignments must prevent privilege escalation
- Firestore Security Rules must prevent unauthorized role modifications
- Client-side role checking is for UX only - server-side validation is mandatory

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/5-development-environment-testing.md]
- **Test File Location**: Create `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native preset
- **Component Testing**: React Native Testing Library for UI components
- **Test Standards**: 
  - Test all role assignment and validation scenarios
  - Mock Firebase services for unit tests
  - Test role-based navigation and UI behavior
  - Verify security rule enforcement
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test customer role assignment during registration
  - Test admin role restrictions and permissions
  - Test role-based route access control
  - Verify unauthorized access prevention
  - Test role modification by admin users
